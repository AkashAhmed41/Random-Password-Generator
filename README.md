# Random-Password-Generator

Random-Password-Generator is a beginner friendly web development project for learning ***React***. This project shows how React Hooks work, in a simple way and how we can make use of those. Besides, the web application is fully responsive for any screen size. I have used ***JavaScript*** and ***Raw CSS*** throughout the whole project.

## How The Project Works

This project can be used to create strong passwords by anyone effortlessly. By default, it generates an 8 character long password for the user on opening, with a combination of the English capital and small letters. The user is then allowed to change the password length, include numerical values and special characters to generate a strong or stronger password with the provided options.

A live working demo of the project can be found here: ***[Random-Password-Provider](https://random-password-provider.netlify.app/)***

## Working with the Source Code

To work with the project and it's source code, first you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) to be installed in your machine. Then create a directory where you want to clone the project and run the following command:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/AkashAhmed41/Random-Password-Generator.git
  ```

After that open the project folder with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Then in a terminal, run the following commands one after another:
```
npm install
npm start
```

These will install all the dependencies and the app will run in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser if the browser doesn't open automatically.
